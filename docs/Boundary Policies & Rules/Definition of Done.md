## Verification Process

### Self-Assessment
1. **Developer Review**: Go through checklist and verify each item
2. **Automated Checks**: Run all tests and code quality checks
3. **Manual Testing**: Test all user workflows manually
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all documentation is complete

### Product Manager Review
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify feature works as intended
2. **User Experience Review**: Assess usability and design
3. **Requirements Verification**: Confirm all acceptance criteria are met
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Test unusual scenarios and error conditions

### Final Sign-off
- [ ] Developer confirms all technical requirements are met
- [ ] Product Manager confirms all functional requirements are met
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Feature is ready for release

## Quality Gates

### Must Pass Before Review
- All automated tests passing
- No TypeScript errors
- Code quality standards met
- Basic functionality working

### Must Pass Before Release
- Product Manager approval
- All checklist items completed
- Documentation updated
- Deployment readiness confirmed

## Common Blockers and Solutions

### Technical Blockers
- **Test failures**: Fix failing tests before proceeding
- **Performance issues**: Optimize before release
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Address immediately
- **TypeScript errors**: Resolve all type issues

### Functional Blockers
- **Requirements unclear**: Clarify with product manager
- **User experience issues**: Iterate on design
- **Edge cases not handled**: Add proper error handling
- **Accessibility issues**: Fix before release

### Compliance Blockers
- **GDPR violations**: Fix data handling issues
- **Security gaps**: Address security requirements
- **Multi-tenancy failures**: Fix data isolation
- **Accessibility failures**: Meet minimum standards

## Emergency Exceptions

In rare cases where immediate fixes are needed, the following items may be deferred **with explicit product manager approval**:

### Deferrable (with approval only):
- Non-critical documentation updates
- Performance optimizations (if within acceptable limits)
- Advanced accessibility features (beyond basic requirements)
- Additional browser compatibility (beyond Chrome, Safari, Edge)

### Never Deferrable:
- Security requirements
- GDPR compliance
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Core functionality
- Critical tests
- Product manager approval

## Continuous Improvement

This Definition of Done should be reviewed and updated regularly based on:
- Lessons learned from production issues
- Changes in compliance requirements
- Evolution of the platform
- User feedback and needs
