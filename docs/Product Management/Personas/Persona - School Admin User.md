# Meet Mrs Barrett - Head Teacher at Weobley Primary

Mrs Barrett has been the head teacher at Weobley Primary School in Herefordshire for eight years. With 240 pupils across seven classes, she's passionate about creating a learning environment where every child can thrive - but she's increasingly concerned about the growing divide in learning habits and parental engagement that she's witnessing across her school community.

**Mrs Barrett wants to build genuine partnerships with families** where learning is seen as a shared responsibility between school and home. She's observed that children who have consistent learning routines and engaged parents make significantly stronger progress - not just academically, but in developing the resilience and self-discipline that will serve them throughout life.

**She always believes that these early primary years are absolutely crucial** for establishing positive learning habits. "If we can help children develop a love of learning and the routine of daily practice now, we're setting them up for success in secondary school and beyond," she explains to her governing body.

**Mrs Barrett's biggest challenge** is creating meaningful ways for parents to engage with their children's learning whilst maintaining the highest standards of child safety. Every new digital platform brings compliance requirements - ICO Children's Code, GDPR, safeguarding policies - that must be carefully navigated whilst still innovating for better educational outcomes.

**What drives her leadership decisions** is knowing that Ofsted increasingly expects schools to demonstrate effective parental engagement strategies with concrete evidence. Her recent school self-evaluation highlighted the need for stronger data around home-school partnerships, and she's acutely aware that anecdotal evidence isn't sufficient for modern inspection frameworks.

**Mrs Barrett's vision is ambitious:** a school community where every family feels confident and equipped to support their child's learning journey, where consistent learning habits are celebrated and nurtured, and where she can demonstrate to inspectors - with real data - how her school successfully engages parents as partners in education.

She's looking for solutions that strengthen the home-school connection whilst ensuring every digital interaction meets the highest standards of child protection and data security that her families rightfully expect.

*Mrs Barrett represents hundreds of primary head teachers across the UK who are balancing the drive for innovation in education with the critical responsibility of keeping children safe in an increasingly digital learning environment.*
