# Meet Miss Chen - Year 4 Teacher at Weobley Primary

Miss Chen has been teaching Year 4 at Weobley Primary for six years. With 29 ten-year-olds in her class, she's passionate about helping each child develop confidence and independence in their learning - but she's finding it increasingly challenging to support every family in building consistent learning routines at home.

**Miss Chen wants to see every child succeed** regardless of their home circumstances. She's noticed that some of her pupils arrive each morning excited to share what they've practised at home, whilst others seem anxious or disconnected from their learning. "I can spot the children who have that regular learning conversation with their families - they're developing resilience and curiosity that goes far beyond just completing tasks," she observes.

**She always believes that parents are their children's first teachers** - they just need the right support and confidence to engage with their child's learning journey. During parents' evenings, she repeatedly hears: "I want to help but I'm not sure I'm doing it right," and "My child gets frustrated and I don't know how to motivate them."

**Miss Chen's biggest challenge** is that her mornings are consumed by checking who's completed their learning activities, following up on missing work, and trying to understand which children need additional support - time she'd rather spend on meaningful teaching and building relationships with her pupils.

**What motivates her every day** is knowing that these formative years are when children develop their attitude towards learning. She wants to celebrate effort and progress in ways that help every child feel capable and motivated, whilst building stronger partnerships with families who are navigating their own challenges around supporting homework.

**Miss Chen's vision is clear:** a classroom where learning extends naturally into the home, where parents feel equipped and confident to support their children, and where every child experiences the joy of consistent progress and recognition for their efforts.

She's looking for ways to strengthen the home-school connection that don't add to her already demanding schedule, but instead help her spot which children need extra support and celebrate the learning habits that will serve her pupils throughout their educational journey.

*Miss Chen represents thousands of dedicated primary teachers across the UK who are seeking practical tools to build stronger learning partnerships with families whilst maintaining their focus on what matters most - helping every child thrive.*
