# Meet Charlie - Year 3 Student at Weobley Primary

Charlie is eight years old and in Miss Chen's Year 3 class. He loves football, building with Lego, and showing off when he masters something new - but homework time has become a daily struggle that makes him feel frustrated and confused about why learning at home feels so different from learning at school.

**Charlie wants to be good at everything** and hates the feeling when homework makes him feel stuck or stupid. He notices that some of his friends like Amelia seem to whizz through their maths homework while he's still trying to understand what the question is asking. "Why is this so easy for everyone else?" he often thinks, which makes him want to give up before he's even started.

**He always tries his best** but homework feels like a test he has to pass rather than a chance to learn something new. His mum tells him "Just do your homework, Charlie" but doesn't always sit down to help him break down the tricky bits. At school, Miss Chen shows him how to work through problems step by step, but at home he's expected to just know how to do it already.

**Charlie's biggest frustration** is the inconsistency at home - when Mum's in charge, homework happens no matter what, but when Dad's looking after him, Charlie has learned he can often avoid it altogether by saying he's too tired or doesn't have any. This makes him feel confused about whether homework actually matters, and guilty when he gets to school the next day unprepared.

**What makes Charlie excited** is when he finally gets something right and can show someone immediately - like when he reads a whole page without stopping or solves a tricky maths problem. He loves getting house points at school and wishes homework had that same feeling of "Yes, I did it!" instead of the constant worry about whether he'll get in trouble for not understanding.

**Charlie's dream** is homework that feels more like the games he plays on his tablet - where he can see he's getting better, where mistakes don't feel scary, and where he can celebrate with his friends when they all do well together. He wants someone to actually help him learn at home, not just tell him to get on with it.

He wants to feel proud of his homework instead of worried about it, and to know that his effort counts even when the answers aren't perfect.

*Charlie represents thousands of primary school children who want to succeed but need homework to feel like a supportive learning experience rather than a nightly test, with consistent expectations and genuine help when they're struggling.*
