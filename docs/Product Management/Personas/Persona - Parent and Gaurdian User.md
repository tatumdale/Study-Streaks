# Meet Sarah Thompson - Parent at Weobley Primary

Sarah is a working mum with two children at Weobley Primary - eight-year-old Emma in Year 3 and five-year-old Jack who just started Year 1. Juggling a part-time marketing role with school pickups and family life, she's deeply committed to supporting her children's education but dreads the daily homework negotiations that have turned her evenings into a battlefield of bribes and bargaining.

**Sarah wants to be the best mum she can be** and give her children every opportunity to succeed. She sees how confident some children seem about their learning and desperately wants that for Emma and Jack. "I know these early years are so important for building good habits, but honestly, most evenings feel like I'm a homework hostage negotiator," she admits to other parents at the school gate.

**She always believes that homework matters** - she can see the difference it makes when Emma has a good week of consistent practice versus when family life gets chaotic. But she's exhausted by the daily battle: "Homework is boring!" from Emma, "But my spelling test isn't until Friday, so I don't need to practice today!" and Jack's creative excuses like "My pencil is too tired to write."

**Sarah's biggest challenge** is the mental gymnastics required just to get started each evening. She's become an expert negotiator - "If you do your reading first, you can have extra screen time," or "Just do half the maths questions and we'll call it done." Some days she's caught herself doing Emma's handwriting practice just to avoid the meltdown, knowing full well she shouldn't.

**What exhausts her most** is the constant creativity required to make homework happen: turning spelling into games, setting timers for "homework races," promising treats, and sometimes just pretending they've done more than they actually have when signing the reading record. She feels like she's failing when she takes shortcuts, but the alternative - tears, tantrums, and family stress - feels worse.

**Sarah's dream is simple:** homework time that doesn't require military-level strategy planning, where her children actually want to engage with their learning, and where she doesn't have to choose between family harmony and educational progress every single evening.

She's looking for something that motivates her children directly - so she can stop being the homework police and start being their cheerleader instead.

*Sarah represents a large portion of primary school parents across the UK - loving, committed, and utterly exhausted by the daily homework negotiations that have turned learning support into a survival strategy.*
